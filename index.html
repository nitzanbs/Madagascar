        <p>
            Spain, country located in extreme southwestern Europe. It occupies about 85 percent of the Iberian Peninsula,
            <br>
            which it shares with its smaller neighbour Portugal.
             <br>
            Spain is a storied country of stone castles, snowcapped mountains, vast monuments, and sophisticated cities, all of
             <br>
            which have made it a favoured travel destination. The country is geographically and culturally diverse. Its heartland is 
            <br>
            the Meseta, a broad central plateau half a mile above sea level.
            <br>
            <br>
             Much of the region is traditionally given over to cattle ranching and grain production; it was in this rural
            <br> 
             setting that Miguel de Cervantes’s Don Quixote tilted at the tall 
            <br>
            windmills that still dot the landscape in several places. In the country’s northeast are the broad valley of the Ebro 
            <br>
            River, the mountainous region of Catalonia, and the hilly coastal plain of Valencia. To the northwest is the Cantabrian 
            <br>
            Mountains, a rugged range in which heavily forested, rain-swept valleys are interspersed with tall peaks. 
            <br>
            <br>

            To the south is the citrus-orchard-rich and irrigated lands of the valley of the Guadalquivir River, 
            <br>
            celebrated in the renowned lyrics of Spanish poets Federico García Lorca and Antonio Machado; over this valley
            <br>
            rises the snowcapped Sierra Nevada. The southern portion of the country is desert, an extension of the Sahara made familiar
            <br>
             to Americans through the “spaghetti western” films of the 1960s and early ’70s. Lined with palm trees, rosemary bushes, 
            <br>
            and other tropical vegetation, the southeastern Mediterranean coast and the Balearic Islands enjoy a gentle climate, 
            <br>
            drawing millions of visitors and retirees, especially from northern Europe.
